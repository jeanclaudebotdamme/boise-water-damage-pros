## Setting Customer Expectations

### Response Time Guidelines

**True Emergencies (Active flooding, sewage, electrical hazard):**
- "Our emergency team can typically be on-site within 60-90 minutes"
- "The contractor will call you within 10-15 minutes to confirm their exact ETA"

**Urgent But Not Life-Threatening (Recent water damage, no active leak):**
- "We can usually have someone there within 2-4 hours today"
- "If it's after 8 PM, first available appointment may be tomorrow morning"

**Non-Emergency Restoration (Mold, finished drying, reconstruction):**
- "We can schedule an assessment within 24-48 hours"
- "Restoration work typically starts within 1-3 business days after assessment"

### Quote Process

**Never promise exact pricing.** Instead:
- "Pricing depends on the extent of damage - the contractor will provide a detailed estimate after inspection"
- "Most restoration companies offer free on-site assessments"
- "If you have insurance, the contractor can work directly with your adjuster on pricing"

**General Cost Ranges (Only if pressed):**
- Water extraction only: $500-$2,000
- Full restoration (per room): $3,000-$10,000+
- Mold remediation: $1,500-$5,000+

## Common Customer Questions & Responses

**"How much will this cost?"**
"Every situation is different. The contractor will provide a detailed estimate after inspecting your property. If you have insurance, they can work directly with your insurance company on pricing. Initial assessments are typically free."

**"When can someone get here?"**
"For emergencies, we typically have contractors on-site within 60-90 minutes. They'll call you within 10-15 minutes to confirm their exact ETA."

**"Do you work with insurance?"**
"Yes, our contractors are experienced with insurance claims and can work directly with your insurance company. They'll document everything needed for your claim."

**"Is the mold dangerous?"**
"Black mold can be hazardous. Our contractors are certified in safe mold remediation and will contain the affected area to protect your family. They can assess the situation when they arrive."

**"How long will it take?"**
"Water extraction and initial drying: 2-3 days. Full restoration depends on damage extent - typically 1-4 weeks for complete rebuild. The contractor will give you a specific timeline after assessment."

**"Can I stay in my house during restoration?"**
"For emergency water extraction, usually yes. For extensive mold remediation or reconstruction, temporary relocation may be recommended. The contractor will advise based on your specific situation."
